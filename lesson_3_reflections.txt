When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It would be useful for sharing files on a subject expecially if a number of people are contributing to the files.
    This would apply to coding or documentation creation. It can also serve as a remote backup available to multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is not really necessary of pull changes unless you are about to make a change and need to latest version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clones and forks make linked copies of entire repositories. A fork credits the original repository on Github.
    Clones are generally used to allow work offline, especially in a programming environment.
    Branches allow for experimentation and parallel developement within the same repository.
    Branches allow for recombination at a later date.
