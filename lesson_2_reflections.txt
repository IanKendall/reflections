How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The working directory contains all the files. The staging area contains the files you want the track. The repository contains the committed versions of files.
1. Edit and save makes change to working directory
"git diff" shows all these
2. "git add <filename>" moves these to staging area.
"git diff --staged" shows difference between staged area and the repository
3. "git reset --hard" resets all changes back to the repository values.

What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
 change?

Each commit looks back to its parent commit so the arrow in the diagram always point back.
The merged diagram can only rank in cronagraphical order but commits retain knowledge of their parents.
