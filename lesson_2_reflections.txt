How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

The working directory contains all the files. The staging area contains the files you want the track. The repository contains the committed versions of files.
1. Edit and save makes change to working directory
"git diff" shows all these
2. "git add <filename>" moves these to staging area.
"git diff --staged" shows difference between staged area and the repository
3. "git reset --hard" resets all changes back to the repository values.

It offers the ability to track when new code or ideas were added or changed. This make it easier to link changes to effects.
